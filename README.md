# KMTNet_Toutatis
This is a repository which will contain jupyter notebooks and other related codes, so that you can reproduce the results that is shown in BachYP+ 2019 JKAS (will be submitted on 2019-01-25 KST).



Although you can directly load the notebooks here on GitHub, they can also be viewed at nbviewer by Jupyter (which I think is more readible and loads quicker).:
